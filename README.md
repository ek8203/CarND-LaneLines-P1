### **Overview**

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go. The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle. 

In this project we automatically detect lane lines in images using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/). We use [Jupiter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) to write and execute [Python](https://www.python.org/) code and [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/) to configure the enviroment for running the code.

In the project directory you can find [Writeup](CarND_writeup_P1.md) document explaining the solution.
